Suppose that $A$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Then $A$ is the direct sum of a free abelian group of finite rank and cyclic groups of prime power order:
\[
  A \isomto \Z^r \oplus \bigoplus_i \Z/p_i^{n_i}\Z.
\]
This decomposition is unique up to order. The direct sum $\bigoplus_i \Z/p_i^{n_i}\Z$ is the \defn{torsion subgroup} of $A$.
