Traditionally, one defines the sequence of Bernoulli numbers $(B_n)$ with the following exponential generating function:
\[
  \frac{x}{e^x-1} = \sum_n \frac{B_n x^n}{n!}.
\]
For all natural numbers $n$, $B_{2n+1} = 0$. 

Jacob Bernoulli wrote about them in his posthumous \ul{Ars conjectandi} of 1713.
