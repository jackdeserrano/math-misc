Let $A$ be a unitary commutative ring. The \defn{Jacobson radical} of $A$ is the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A$:
\[
\mathfrak J(A) := \bigcap_{\mathfrak m \textrm{ maximal}} \mathfrak m.
\]
Notice that the Jacobson radical contains the nilradical of $A$. This is an ideal since it is an intersection of ideals.
